   <p>The idea of a dream destination is a much more profound one than a tropical resort or an exotic country.The turning points in our lives, the sliding doors carrying our what if’s and Im glad’s are the settings we wish to return to.The times that brought us to who we are now.This vortex shows the points of my life in a visual distillation.It puts all the years minutes and seconds in a simple perspective.Where you can have your dream vacation as a onlooker to the decisions that brought you here.</p>
