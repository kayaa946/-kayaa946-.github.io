			<p>What if we told you there was a man with two hooks for hands named J.J. Armes? The moniker seems a little too on the nose, but indeed Jay J. Armes is real person. Armes was 11 years old when he mangled his hands playing with railroad torpedoes. Doctors amputated his badly damaged extremities. After appearing as a sniper in "Hookman," a memorable episode of Hawaii Five-O, Armes began to develop his own TV series with CBS. In real life, Armes had his own detective agency, and a line of dolls, complete with mobile investigation van.
